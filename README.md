# Message Extension app with Teams AI SDK and Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code v5

A Message Extension allows users to interact with your web service while composing messages in the Microsoft Teams client. Users can invoke your web service to assist message composition, from the message compose box, or from the search bar.

Message Extensions are implemented on top of the Bot support architecture within Teams.

This message extension action command capability is built using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code v5 with the integration of Teams AI SDK and Microsoft Graph.
